If you've been around peptide research for any amount of time, you've probably heard TB-500 mentioned in the same breath as BPC-157. And for good reason — it's one of the most studied peptides for tissue repair and recovery, with a mechanism of action that's genuinely different from anything else on the market.

But there's a lot of noise out there. Half the information floating around forums is outdated, oversimplified, or flat-out wrong. So let's cut through it.

*All information in this article is for educational and research purposes only. TB-500 is a research peptide and is not approved by the FDA for human use. Nothing here constitutes medical advice.*

## What Is TB-500, Really?

TB-500 is a synthetic version of a naturally occurring 43-amino-acid peptide called Thymosin Beta-4 (Tb4). Your body already produces Thymosin Beta-4 — it's found in virtually every cell and plays a major role in how tissues heal after injury. TB-500 replicates the active region of that protein.

It was first identified in the thymus gland (hence the name), but don't let that fool you into thinking it's only involved in immune function. Thymosin Beta-4 is one of the most abundant intracellular peptides in the human body. It shows up in wound fluid, blood platelets, and pretty much anywhere the body is trying to repair itself.

The key thing that sets TB-500 apart from other repair peptides? It works systemically. You don't need to inject it right next to the injury site. I've seen researchers get results with standard subcutaneous injections in the abdomen while studying knee or shoulder tissue models. That's a big deal.

## How TB-500 Works

Here's where it gets interesting. TB-500's primary mechanism revolves around a protein you've probably never thought about: actin.

### Actin Regulation

Actin is one of the most critical structural proteins in your cells. It forms the internal scaffolding (cytoskeleton) that gives cells their shape and allows them to move. TB-500 binds to actin and promotes its polymerization — basically helping cells build the structural framework they need to migrate to injury sites and begin repairs.

This is why TB-500 is so effective at promoting cell migration. Damaged tissue needs new cells to show up, and TB-500 gives those cells the structural tools to get there faster.

### Anti-Inflammatory Action

TB-500 downregulates inflammatory cytokines at injury sites. Inflammation is part of the healing process, sure, but excessive or prolonged inflammation actually slows recovery and causes additional tissue damage. TB-500 helps keep that inflammatory response in check without suppressing it entirely.

### Blood Vessel Formation

The peptide promotes angiogenesis — the growth of new blood vessels. More blood flow to damaged tissue means more oxygen, more nutrients, and faster removal of waste products. This is particularly relevant in research on tendon and ligament injuries, where blood supply is naturally limited.

### What the Research Shows

The published literature on Thymosin Beta-4 is actually quite robust. Studies have demonstrated accelerated healing in:

- Corneal injuries (some of the earliest and strongest evidence)
- Cardiac tissue after ischemic events
- Skin wounds and dermal injuries
- Tendon and ligament damage
- Muscle injuries including muscle contusions
- Neurological tissue (early-stage research but promising)

One thing I want to be honest about: most of this research is preclinical. The corneal studies are the furthest along in terms of human application, with a Thymosin Beta-4 eye drop (RegeneRx) that went through clinical trials. But for musculoskeletal applications, we're still largely working from animal model data and anecdotal research reports.

## Dosing Protocol

This is probably what you came here for. TB-500 dosing follows a loading/maintenance structure, which is different from peptides like BPC-157 that use consistent daily dosing.

### Loading Phase (Weeks 1-4 to 1-6)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Dose | 2-5 mg per injection |
| Frequency | Twice per week |
| Duration | 4-6 weeks |

The loading phase front-loads the peptide to build up systemic levels. Most researchers start at 2.5 mg twice weekly and adjust from there based on the research model. For larger study subjects or more significant tissue damage, doses up to 5 mg twice weekly have been used.

### Maintenance Phase

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Dose | 2 mg per injection |
| Frequency | Once per week |
| Duration | 4-8 weeks (or as needed) |

After the loading phase, you drop to maintenance. The idea is that you've already saturated the tissue and now you're just topping off. Some researchers extend the maintenance phase for as long as they're studying a particular injury model.

### Total Protocol Length

A typical full cycle runs 8-12 weeks (4-6 loading + 4-6 maintenance), followed by an off period. And yeah, you actually need the off period — running peptides indefinitely without breaks isn't good research practice.

So what does this look like in practical terms? For a 5 mg vial reconstituted with 2 mL of bacteriostatic water, your concentration is 2,500 mcg/mL (or 2.5 mg/mL). To pull a 2.5 mg dose, you'd draw 1 mL. To pull 2 mg, you'd draw 0.8 mL.

Don't want to do that math every time? Use our [Peptide Reconstitution Calculator](/calculator) — plug in your vial size and desired dose, and it handles the rest.

## Reconstitution

TB-500 comes as a lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder. You'll need to reconstitute it before use.

![Syringe and medical supplies](/images/blog/syringe-medical.jpg)

### What you need:

- TB-500 lyophilized vial (typically 5 mg or 10 mg)
- Bacteriostatic water (BAC water)
- Sterile insulin syringes
- Alcohol swabs

### The process:

1. Wipe down both vial tops with alcohol swabs. Let them dry.
2. Draw your desired volume of BAC water into a syringe. For a 5 mg vial, 1-2 mL is standard.
3. Insert the needle into the TB-500 vial and release the water slowly against the glass wall. Don't blast it directly onto the powder — peptides are fragile and aggressive reconstitution can damage the molecular structure.
4. Swirl gently. Don't shake. You should end up with a clear, colorless solution.
5. Label with the date and concentration.

### Quick reference concentrations:

| Vial Size | BAC Water | Concentration | 2.5 mg = |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| 5 mg | 1 mL | 5 mg/mL | 0.5 mL (50 units) |
| 5 mg | 2 mL | 2.5 mg/mL | 1 mL (100 units) |
| 10 mg | 2 mL | 5 mg/mL | 0.5 mL (50 units) |
| 10 mg | 4 mL | 2.5 mg/mL | 1 mL (100 units) |

## Subcutaneous Injection: Systemic vs. Localized

Here's a question that comes up constantly: should you inject near the injury site or does it matter?

Short answer — it probably doesn't matter much with TB-500.

Unlike BPC-157, which has some evidence supporting localized injection for targeted effects, TB-500 is designed to work systemically. The peptide's molecular weight is low enough that it distributes throughout the body effectively after a standard subcutaneous injection. Researchers studying knee injuries, for example, have reported similar outcomes whether they inject in the abdomen or near the knee.

That said, some researchers still prefer to inject closer to the area of interest, operating on the logic that higher local concentrations can't hurt. There's no strong data either way on this specific question. My take? Don't overthink it. Abdomen, upper thigh, or deltoid area — pick a comfortable site and rotate.

## The Wolverine Stack: TB-500 + BPC-157

Okay, this is the one everyone asks about.

Combining TB-500 with BPC-157 is the most popular peptide stack in the research community, and the logic behind it is sound. These two peptides work through completely different mechanisms:

- **BPC-157** drives localized repair through nitric oxide modulation, growth factor upregulation (VEGF, EGF), and the FAK-paxillin pathway
- **TB-500** promotes systemic repair through actin regulation, cell migration, and broad anti-inflammatory signaling

They're complementary, not redundant. BPC-157 is building new blood vessels and depositing collagen at the injury site. TB-500 is sending repair cells to that site and keeping inflammation from getting out of control. Together, they cover both the local and systemic sides of the healing equation.

### Wolverine Stack Protocol

| Peptide | Dose | Frequency | Duration |
|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| BPC-157 | 250-500 mcg | Once or twice daily | 4-8 weeks |
| TB-500 | 2-5 mg | 2x/week (loading), 1x/week (maintenance) | 4-8 weeks |

Some researchers run them in the same syringe (they're chemically compatible), while others prefer separate injections. Either approach works fine. The main thing is consistency — pick a schedule and stick with it.

## Storage

TB-500 storage is straightforward, but getting it wrong will tank your results.

**Lyophilized (before reconstitution):**
- Freezer (-20°C) for long-term storage — stable for 24+ months
- Refrigerator (2-8°C) acceptable for several months
- Keep away from light

**Reconstituted:**
- Refrigerator only. Never room temperature.
- Use bacteriostatic water (the benzyl alcohol acts as a preservative)
- Good for approximately 28-30 days when stored properly
- Never freeze reconstituted peptide — freeze-thaw cycles destroy it

If the solution turns cloudy, develops particles, or has been sitting for more than 30 days, toss it. Degraded peptide isn't just ineffective — it's a variable you don't want in your research.

## Where to Buy TB-500

Quality matters more with peptides than almost any other research compound. A low-purity vial doesn't just give you less active peptide — it gives you unknown contaminants that can confound your results entirely.

What to look for in a supplier:

- Third-party certificates of analysis (COA) with HPLC purity testing at 98%+
- Properly sealed, light-protected vials
- Clear labeling with peptide weight, lot number, and sequence information
- A track record in the research community

I recommend **Peptide Restore**. They provide third-party tested, research-grade TB-500 with full COAs, and they carry both individual vials and the popular BPC-157 + TB-500 blend.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly does TB-500 start working?

Most research protocols report observable effects within 1-2 weeks, though this varies by injury model and severity. The loading phase exists specifically to accelerate the timeline — you're building up systemic levels as fast as reasonably possible. Full protocol results are typically assessed at the 6-8 week mark.

### Is TB-500 the same as Thymosin Beta-4?

Technically, TB-500 is a synthetic peptide that replicates the active region of Thymosin Beta-4. The terms are often used interchangeably in the research community, which isn't perfectly accurate but is generally understood. The full Thymosin Beta-4 protein is 43 amino acids; TB-500 contains the same sequence and key active fragment.

### Can I use TB-500 without BPC-157?

Absolutely. TB-500 is effective as a standalone peptide. The stack with BPC-157 is popular because the two complement each other, but plenty of researchers run TB-500 solo, particularly for systemic recovery protocols where the anti-inflammatory and cell-migration effects are the primary interest.

### Where should I inject TB-500?

Subcutaneous injection in the abdomen, upper thigh, or deltoid area. TB-500 works systemically, so the injection site doesn't need to be near the area of research interest. Rotate sites to avoid irritation.

### How should I reconstitute TB-500?

Add bacteriostatic water to the lyophilized vial — slowly, against the glass wall. For a 5 mg vial, 1-2 mL of BAC water is standard. Swirl gently (never shake) until the solution is clear. Use our [reconstitution calculator](/calculator) to determine exact volumes for your target dose, and see the [full reconstitution guide](/blog/how-to-reconstitute-peptides) for step-by-step instructions.

### What are the side effects of TB-500 in research?

In the published animal literature, Thymosin Beta-4 has shown a favorable safety profile. The most commonly noted side effects in anecdotal research reports are temporary head rush or lightheadedness shortly after injection, and occasional mild lethargy. These tend to be transient. However, human clinical data is limited, and all research should be conducted under appropriate oversight.

### Is TB-500 legal?

TB-500 is legal to purchase and possess for research purposes in the United States and most jurisdictions. It is classified as a research chemical, not a pharmaceutical product. Researchers are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable local laws and institutional guidelines.
