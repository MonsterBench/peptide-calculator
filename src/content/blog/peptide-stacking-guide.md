Peptide stacking is the practice of combining two or more peptides in a single research protocol to achieve synergistic effects that no single compound can deliver alone. Rather than relying on one mechanism of action, a well-designed peptide stack targets multiple biological pathways simultaneously, amplifying outcomes across tissue repair, hormonal optimization, immune function, and more.

This guide covers the most widely studied peptide combinations, how to time and schedule them, and what to consider before building your own stack. All information is provided for educational and research purposes only.

## What Is Peptide Stacking?

Peptide stacking refers to running two or more peptides concurrently within a structured protocol. Each peptide in the stack is selected because its mechanism of action complements the others, creating a combined effect that exceeds what any single peptide would produce in isolation.

For example, BPC-157 promotes angiogenesis and tendon healing through nitric oxide pathways, while TB-500 promotes cellular migration and reduces inflammation through actin regulation. Used together, they address tissue repair from two distinct angles, which is why their combination is one of the most popular stacks in peptide research.

Stacking is not random mixing. Effective stacks are built on an understanding of each peptide's receptor targets, half-life, and dosing window so that the compounds work together rather than against each other.

## Why Stack Peptides?

There are several reasons researchers choose to combine peptides rather than use them individually:

- **Synergistic mechanisms**: Peptides that act on complementary pathways can produce results greater than the sum of their parts. A growth-hormone-releasing peptide paired with a growth-hormone-releasing hormone analog is a classic example.
- **Broader coverage**: A single peptide may address one aspect of a complex biological process. Stacking allows a protocol to target multiple aspects at once, such as combining tissue repair peptides with anti-inflammatory peptides.
- **Optimized timing**: Some peptides work best at different points in a biological cycle. Stacking lets researchers align each compound to its optimal window.
- **Reduced individual dosing**: When two peptides amplify each other's effects, it may be possible to use lower doses of each while still achieving the desired outcome.

## Top Research Stacks

Below are six well-documented peptide stacks, organized by primary research goal. Each includes the peptides involved, their individual roles, and general dosing ranges found in published literature and community research logs.

### 1. BPC-157 + TB-500 — The Wolverine Stack (Tissue Repair)

This is the most widely recognized peptide stack in the research community, often called the "Wolverine Stack" for its robust tissue-repair properties.

| Peptide | Role | Typical Research Dose |
|---------|------|-----------------------|
| BPC-157 | Angiogenesis, tendon/ligament repair, gut healing via nitric oxide modulation | 250-500 mcg/day |
| TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4) | Cell migration, inflammation reduction, actin upregulation for tissue remodeling | 2-5 mg twice per week (loading), then 2 mg/week (maintenance) |

**Why it works**: BPC-157 accelerates blood vessel formation and collagen deposition at injury sites, while TB-500 promotes the migration of repair cells to damaged tissue and reduces the inflammatory cascade. Together, they create an environment where healing is both faster and more complete.

**Protocol notes**: Many researchers run this stack for 4-8 weeks. BPC-157 is typically administered daily (subcutaneously near the site of interest or systemically), while TB-500 follows a loading/maintenance schedule.

For a deeper dive into BPC-157 on its own, see our [complete BPC-157 guide](/blog/bpc-157-guide).

### 2. CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin — Growth Hormone Optimization Stack

This is the gold-standard stack for researchers studying growth hormone (GH) secretion patterns.

| Peptide | Role | Typical Research Dose |
|---------|------|-----------------------|
| CJC-1295 (no DAC) / Mod GRF 1-29 | GHRH analog that stimulates GH release from the pituitary | 100 mcg per injection |
| Ipamorelin | Selective ghrelin receptor agonist that amplifies GH pulse without raising cortisol or prolactin | 100-200 mcg per injection |

**Why it works**: CJC-1295 tells the pituitary gland to release growth hormone, while Ipamorelin amplifies that signal by acting on a completely separate receptor (the ghrelin receptor). The result is a larger, cleaner GH pulse than either peptide can produce alone, without the side-effect profile associated with non-selective GH secretagogues like GHRP-6.

**Protocol notes**: Typically administered together in the same injection 1-3 times daily (common timing: morning, post-workout, and before bed). The pre-bed dose aligns with the body's natural nocturnal GH pulse for maximum effect. Protocols generally run 8-12 weeks with periodic breaks.

### 3. BPC-157 + TB-500 + GHK-Cu — The Glow Stack (Repair + Skin Rejuvenation)

This three-peptide stack extends the Wolverine Stack with a copper peptide known for its effects on skin quality and collagen remodeling.

| Peptide | Role | Typical Research Dose |
|---------|------|-----------------------|
| BPC-157 | Systemic tissue repair and angiogenesis | 250-500 mcg/day |
| TB-500 | Cell migration and anti-inflammatory action | 2-5 mg twice/week (loading), 2 mg/week (maintenance) |
| GHK-Cu | Copper tripeptide that stimulates collagen synthesis, elastin production, and glycosaminoglycan formation | 1-2 mg/day (subcutaneous) or topical application |

**Why it works**: While BPC-157 and TB-500 handle deep tissue repair, GHK-Cu adds a dermal regeneration layer. GHK-Cu has been shown in studies to activate over 4,000 genes involved in tissue remodeling, with particularly strong effects on skin elasticity, wound healing, and hair follicle health. The combination addresses both structural tissue repair and surface-level skin quality.

**Protocol notes**: GHK-Cu can be administered subcutaneously alongside BPC-157, or applied topically to target specific areas. Researchers often run this stack for 6-8 weeks. The "Glow Stack" name comes from the visible improvements in skin texture and tone frequently reported during research.

### 4. Semaglutide + BPC-157 — Metabolic + Gut Protection Stack

This stack pairs a GLP-1 receptor agonist with a gastric-protective peptide to support metabolic research while mitigating common gastrointestinal side effects.

| Peptide | Role | Typical Research Dose |
|---------|------|-----------------------|
| Semaglutide | GLP-1 receptor agonist that reduces appetite, improves insulin sensitivity, and slows gastric emptying | Titrated from 0.25 mg/week up to 1-2.4 mg/week |
| BPC-157 | Protects gastric mucosa, promotes gut healing, counteracts GI inflammation | 250-500 mcg/day |

**Why it works**: Semaglutide is one of the most studied peptides for metabolic research, but its mechanism of slowing gastric emptying frequently causes nausea, constipation, and other GI discomfort in research models. BPC-157 is a gastric pentadecapeptide originally isolated from gastric juice, and it has well-documented protective effects on the GI lining. Using BPC-157 alongside semaglutide may help preserve gut integrity during extended metabolic protocols.

**Protocol notes**: Semaglutide is administered once weekly with a slow titration schedule (typically increasing the dose every 4 weeks). BPC-157 is administered daily throughout the protocol. Many researchers begin BPC-157 one week before introducing semaglutide to establish baseline gut protection.

### 5. GHK-Cu + NAD+ — Anti-Aging Stack

This stack targets cellular aging from two complementary directions: extracellular matrix remodeling and intracellular energy metabolism.

| Peptide / Molecule | Role | Typical Research Dose |
|---------------------|------|-----------------------|
| GHK-Cu | Gene expression modulation favoring youthful tissue remodeling, collagen synthesis, antioxidant enzyme activation | 1-2 mg/day (subcutaneous) |
| NAD+ (or precursors like NMN) | Coenzyme critical for mitochondrial function, DNA repair via sirtuins, and cellular energy production | 50-100 mg IV, or sublingual/subcutaneous NMN at 100-250 mg/day |

**Why it works**: GHK-Cu addresses aging at the structural level by activating genes associated with tissue repair and suppressing genes linked to inflammation and tissue destruction. NAD+ operates at the metabolic level, fueling sirtuins (the "longevity enzymes") that regulate DNA repair, mitochondrial biogenesis, and cellular stress resistance. Together, they represent a two-pronged approach to age-related decline: rebuilding tissue architecture while restoring cellular energy capacity.

**Protocol notes**: This stack is often run in 4-6 week cycles. GHK-Cu is administered daily via subcutaneous injection, while NAD+ delivery method varies by research setup (IV, subcutaneous, or oral precursors). Some researchers add low-dose epithalon (epitalon) to this stack for additional telomere-related research.

### 6. Thymosin Alpha-1 + KPV + BPC-157 — Immune + Gut Health Stack

This triple stack is designed for research into immune modulation and gut barrier integrity.

| Peptide | Role | Typical Research Dose |
|---------|------|-----------------------|
| Thymosin Alpha-1 (Ta1) | Immune modulator that enhances dendritic cell activity, T-cell maturation, and NK cell function | 1.6 mg twice/week (subcutaneous) |
| KPV | Anti-inflammatory tripeptide derived from alpha-MSH; targets NF-kB and MAPK inflammatory pathways in the gut | 200-500 mcg/day (subcutaneous or oral) |
| BPC-157 | Gut mucosal protection, angiogenesis, systemic anti-inflammatory effects | 250-500 mcg/day |

**Why it works**: Thymosin Alpha-1 is an FDA-approved peptide in over 30 countries for its immune-enhancing properties, making it the backbone of the immune component. KPV directly suppresses intestinal inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production, while BPC-157 protects and heals the gut lining itself. The combination addresses immune competence (Ta1), active inflammation (KPV), and structural gut repair (BPC-157) in a single protocol.

**Protocol notes**: This stack is typically run for 6-12 weeks. Ta1 is administered on a twice-weekly schedule, while KPV and BPC-157 are dosed daily. Some researchers administer KPV orally in enteric-coated capsules to target the GI tract directly.

## Timing and Scheduling

Getting the timing right is just as important as choosing the right peptides. Here are general scheduling principles for peptide stacks:

- **Same-syringe compatibility**: Many peptides can be combined in the same syringe for a single injection (e.g., CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin, or BPC-157 + TB-500). This reduces injection frequency without affecting efficacy. However, always verify chemical compatibility before combining compounds in solution.
- **Fasted vs. fed state**: Growth-hormone-related peptides (CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, and other GHRPs) should generally be administered in a fasted state or at least 2 hours after eating. Elevated blood sugar and insulin blunt the GH response. BPC-157 and TB-500 can be administered regardless of food intake.
- **Time of day**: GH stacks benefit from evening or pre-bed dosing to coincide with natural GH pulses during deep sleep. Repair peptides like BPC-157 and TB-500 are effective at any time but are commonly dosed in the morning or split into AM/PM doses.
- **Loading phases**: TB-500 and Thymosin Alpha-1 both benefit from an initial loading phase (higher frequency/dose for the first 2-4 weeks) followed by a maintenance phase. Other peptides in the stack typically maintain consistent daily dosing throughout.
- **Cycle length and breaks**: Most peptide stacks are run for 4-12 weeks followed by an off period of equal or greater length. This prevents receptor desensitization and allows assessment of results.

Our [peptide calculator](/calculator) can help you determine exact volumes per injection when running multi-peptide protocols.

## Pre-Made Blends vs. Individual Peptides

Researchers have two main options for sourcing peptide stacks: purchasing pre-made blends or buying individual peptides and combining them.

**Pre-made blends** offer several advantages:

- Precise ratios already established based on common research protocols
- Fewer vials to manage and reconstitute
- Reduced risk of measurement errors when drawing multiple compounds
- Often more cost-effective than purchasing each peptide separately

**Individual peptides** offer:

- Full control over dosing ratios and the ability to adjust each compound independently
- Flexibility to add or remove peptides from the stack mid-protocol
- The option to source each peptide from the vendor with the best quality and price for that specific compound

For researchers running established stacks like the Wolverine Stack (BPC-157 + TB-500), pre-made blends are often the most practical choice. For more customized or experimental protocols, individual peptides provide greater flexibility.

## Building Your Protocol

When designing a peptide stack from scratch, follow these steps:

1. **Define your research objective**: Are you focused on tissue repair, GH optimization, anti-aging, metabolic research, or immune modulation? Your goal determines which peptide categories to draw from.

2. **Select complementary mechanisms**: Choose peptides that work through different pathways. Stacking two peptides with identical mechanisms rarely outperforms using one at a higher dose.

3. **Check interactions and contraindications**: While peptide-peptide interactions are generally rare, always review available literature for the specific compounds you plan to combine.

4. **Plan your dosing schedule**: Map out daily, twice-weekly, and weekly administrations on a calendar. Account for loading phases and reconstitution schedules so you do not run out of prepared solution mid-protocol.

5. **Start conservatively**: When running a new stack, begin at the lower end of established dose ranges. Assess response before titrating upward.

6. **Track everything**: Maintain a research log with dates, doses, injection sites, reconstitution details, and observations. This data is invaluable for optimizing future protocols.

Need help with the math? The [peptide dosing calculator](/calculator) handles reconstitution volumes, concentration calculations, and per-dose measurements for any peptide in your stack.

## Safety Considerations

Peptide stacking introduces additional variables that require careful attention:

- **Quality sourcing**: Every peptide in your stack should come from a supplier that provides third-party certificates of analysis (COA) verifying identity and purity (98%+ is the standard threshold).
- **Proper storage**: Reconstituted peptides are sensitive to heat, light, and bacterial contamination. Store lyophilized peptides in a freezer and reconstituted peptides in a refrigerator. Use bacteriostatic water for reconstitution to extend shelf life to 4-6 weeks.
- **Injection hygiene**: When running multiple daily injections, rotate injection sites to prevent lipodystrophy. Always use fresh needles and alcohol swabs.
- **Complexity management**: More peptides in a stack means more variables. If an unexpected response occurs, it becomes harder to identify the responsible compound. This is another reason to start with established two-peptide stacks before building more complex protocols.
- **Reconstitution accuracy**: Incorrect reconstitution can lead to significant dosing errors that compound across a multi-peptide stack. Review our [reconstitution guide](/blog/how-to-reconstitute-peptides) and use the [calculator](/calculator) to verify your measurements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I mix multiple peptides in the same syringe?

In many cases, yes. Peptides that are chemically stable at similar pH levels can be drawn into the same syringe and administered together. Common compatible combinations include BPC-157 + TB-500 and CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin. However, some peptides may degrade or interact when mixed in solution for extended periods. As a rule, combine immediately before injection rather than storing mixed solutions.

### How long should I run a peptide stack?

Most stacks are run for 4-12 weeks depending on the compounds involved and the research objective. Tissue repair stacks (BPC-157 + TB-500) often run 4-8 weeks, while GH optimization and anti-aging stacks may extend to 12 weeks. Always include an off-cycle period to assess results and prevent receptor desensitization.

### Do peptide stacks have more side effects than single peptides?

Not necessarily. Well-designed stacks use peptides with clean side-effect profiles (which is why Ipamorelin is preferred over GHRP-6 in GH stacks). However, adding more compounds does increase complexity, and if a side effect emerges, it can be harder to identify the cause. Starting with established, well-documented stacks minimizes this risk.

### What is the best beginner peptide stack?

The BPC-157 + TB-500 (Wolverine Stack) is widely considered the most accessible starting point. Both peptides have extensive research backing, favorable safety profiles, and straightforward dosing schedules. The CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin stack is the standard entry point for GH-related research.

### Should I take all peptides at the same time of day?

Not always. GH-releasing peptides should be taken on an empty stomach, ideally before bed or first thing in the morning. Repair peptides like BPC-157 are flexible on timing. When in doubt, consult the specific timing guidelines for each peptide in your stack and build a schedule that accommodates all of them.

### Where can I source quality peptides for stacking?
