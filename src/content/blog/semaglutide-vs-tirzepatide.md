## Overview of GLP-1 Agonists

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are a class of peptides that mimic the incretin hormone GLP-1. In the body, GLP-1 is released by the gut after eating and plays a central role in glucose homeostasis, appetite regulation, and gastric motility.

Pharmaceutical GLP-1 agonists were originally developed for type 2 diabetes management. However, clinical research quickly revealed significant effects on body weight, making them a major area of interest for obesity research. The three peptides covered in this **GLP-1 comparison** represent three generations of this approach:

- **Semaglutide** -- A selective GLP-1 receptor agonist (single agonist)
- **Tirzepatide** -- A dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist
- **Retatrutide** -- A triple GLP-1/GIP/glucagon receptor agonist

Each successive generation targets additional receptor pathways, and early research suggests that the multi-agonist approach may yield more pronounced results.

## How Each One Works: Mechanism Differences

### Semaglutide (GLP-1 Agonist)

Semaglutide binds selectively to the GLP-1 receptor. Its primary mechanisms include:

- **Appetite suppression** via hypothalamic signaling, reducing hunger and caloric intake
- **Delayed gastric emptying**, which promotes satiety after meals
- **Enhanced insulin secretion** in a glucose-dependent manner
- **Reduced glucagon release**, improving blood sugar regulation

Semaglutide has a half-life of approximately 7 days due to its albumin-binding fatty acid chain, making it suitable for once-weekly administration. Clinical trials (STEP program) demonstrated average weight loss of 15-17% of body weight over 68 weeks.

### Tirzepatide (Dual GIP/GLP-1 Agonist)

Tirzepatide activates both the GLP-1 and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptors. This dual mechanism is what sets **tirzepatide dosing** protocols apart from semaglutide-only approaches:

- **GLP-1 activity** provides the same appetite suppression and gastric slowing as semaglutide
- **GIP activity** enhances insulin sensitivity, improves lipid metabolism, and may contribute to fat oxidation
- The combination appears to produce **synergistic effects** on weight and metabolic markers

Tirzepatide also has an approximately 5-day half-life, supporting once-weekly injection. The SURMOUNT trials demonstrated average weight loss of 20-26% of body weight, representing a meaningful improvement over semaglutide monotherapy.

### Retatrutide (Triple GLP-1/GIP/Glucagon Agonist)

**Retatrutide** is the newest entrant, adding glucagon receptor agonism to the GLP-1 and GIP activity:

- **GLP-1 and GIP activity** mirrors tirzepatide's dual mechanism
- **Glucagon receptor activation** increases energy expenditure, promotes hepatic fat oxidation, and may reduce liver fat content
- Early phase 2 trial data showed average weight loss of up to **24% at 48 weeks**, with some cohorts exceeding this

The glucagon component is particularly interesting because it addresses energy expenditure on the output side of the equation, rather than relying solely on appetite suppression and metabolic improvement. Retatrutide remains investigational and is not yet FDA-approved.

## Titration Schedules

Titration is critical for minimizing gastrointestinal side effects. Each peptide follows a gradual dose-escalation protocol. Below are the standard research titration schedules.

### Semaglutide Titration Schedule

| Weeks | Dose (once weekly) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 | 0.25 mg | Initiation / GI acclimation |
| 5-8 | 0.5 mg | Low therapeutic dose |
| 9-12 | 1.0 mg | Standard therapeutic dose |
| 13-16 | 1.7 mg | Escalation (if tolerated) |
| 17+ | 2.4 mg | Maximum research dose |

Dose escalation should only proceed if the current dose is well tolerated. If significant GI symptoms occur, remain at the current dose for an additional 4 weeks before attempting escalation.

### Tirzepatide Titration Schedule

| Weeks | Dose (once weekly) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 | 2.5 mg | Initiation / GI acclimation |
| 5-8 | 5.0 mg | Low therapeutic dose |
| 9-12 | 7.5 mg | Mid-range dose |
| 13-16 | 10.0 mg | Standard therapeutic dose |
| 17-20 | 12.5 mg | Escalation (if tolerated) |
| 21+ | 15.0 mg | Maximum research dose |

**Tirzepatide dosing** follows a similar 4-week-per-step cadence. The wider dose range means titration takes longer to reach the maximum, but this gradual approach is important for tolerability.

### Retatrutide Titration Schedule

| Weeks | Dose (once weekly) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 | 1.0 mg | Initiation / GI acclimation |
| 5-8 | 2.0 mg | Low dose escalation |
| 9-12 | 4.0 mg | Mid-range dose |
| 13-16 | 8.0 mg | Standard research dose |
| 17+ | 12.0 mg | Maximum studied dose |

**Retatrutide** titration data comes from the phase 2 trial. The dose jumps are larger in proportion, so careful monitoring during escalation is essential.

## Reconstitution and Dosing

All three peptides are commonly supplied as lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder for research use and require reconstitution with bacteriostatic water (BAC water) before administration.

**General reconstitution steps:**

1. Allow the vial to reach room temperature before reconstitution
2. Using a sterile syringe, draw the desired volume of bacteriostatic water
3. Inject the water slowly along the inside wall of the vial -- do not spray directly onto the powder
4. Gently swirl the vial until the powder is fully dissolved; never shake vigorously
5. Label the vial with the date of reconstitution and the concentration

For a detailed walkthrough with visual guidance, see our complete guide: [How to Reconstitute Peptides](/blog/how-to-reconstitute-peptides).

**Calculating your concentration:**

The concentration after reconstitution depends on how much BAC water you add. For example, if you have a 5 mg vial of semaglutide and add 2 mL of BAC water, your concentration is 2.5 mg/mL.

Use the [Peptide Dosing Calculator](/calculator) to determine the exact injection volume for your target dose based on your reconstitution ratio.

**Storage after reconstitution:**

Reconstituted peptides should be stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius (standard refrigerator temperature) and are typically stable for 4-6 weeks. Avoid freezing reconstituted solutions. For detailed stability data and best practices, read our guide on [Peptide Storage and Stability](/blog/peptide-storage-stability).

## Side Effects in Research

The side effect profiles of these three peptides share significant overlap, primarily involving gastrointestinal symptoms. Proper titration substantially reduces the incidence and severity of these effects.

### Common Side Effects (All Three)

- **Nausea** -- the most frequently reported side effect, typically most pronounced during dose escalation
- **Decreased appetite** -- expected pharmacological effect, not always classified as adverse
- **Diarrhea or constipation** -- varies between individuals
- **Injection site reactions** -- mild redness or irritation at the injection location
- **Fatigue** -- occasionally reported during the initiation phase

### Semaglutide-Specific Considerations

- GI side effects tend to be moderate and dose-dependent
- Nausea rates in STEP trials were approximately 44% but led to discontinuation in only ~5% of subjects
- Pancreatitis has been reported rarely

### Tirzepatide-Specific Considerations

- GI side effect rates are comparable to semaglutide despite the dual mechanism
- The GIP component may actually improve GI tolerability compared to pure GLP-1 activation
- Nausea rates in SURMOUNT trials were approximately 29-31%, lower than semaglutide in some comparisons

### Retatrutide-Specific Considerations

- The glucagon receptor component may cause transient increases in heart rate
- GI side effects appear dose-dependent with higher rates at the 12 mg dose
- Phase 2 data showed nausea in approximately 26% of subjects at moderate doses
- Longer-term safety data is still being collected in ongoing phase 3 trials

> **Research note:** Side effect monitoring should be systematic and documented. Any severe or unexpected reactions should prompt dose reduction or discontinuation and consultation with a medical professional. For research use only.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the main difference between semaglutide and tirzepatide?

The primary difference in the **semaglutide vs tirzepatide** comparison is receptor selectivity. Semaglutide targets only the GLP-1 receptor, while tirzepatide is a dual agonist targeting both GLP-1 and GIP receptors. This dual mechanism is associated with greater average weight reduction in clinical trials (20-26% vs 15-17%) and potentially improved metabolic outcomes.

### Is retatrutide better than tirzepatide?

It is too early to make definitive claims. **Retatrutide** has shown promising phase 2 data with up to 24% weight loss at 48 weeks, but it has not completed phase 3 trials and lacks the long-term safety data available for tirzepatide. The addition of glucagon receptor agonism is mechanistically interesting but requires further validation.

### Can you switch between these peptides?

In clinical settings, switching between GLP-1 agonists is done under medical supervision. For research protocols, any transition should include an appropriate washout period based on each peptide's half-life (typically 5-6 half-lives, or approximately 4-6 weeks).

### How do I calculate my dosing after reconstitution?

Use our free [Peptide Dosing Calculator](/calculator). Input your vial size, the amount of bacteriostatic water added, and your target dose. The calculator will return the exact injection volume in units and milliliters.

### What is the best injection site?

Subcutaneous injection is standard for all three peptides. Common sites include the abdomen (at least 2 inches from the navel), upper thigh, or upper arm. Rotate injection sites to reduce irritation.

### How should I store reconstituted peptides?

Reconstituted peptides should be refrigerated at 2-8 degrees Celsius and used within 4-6 weeks. Never freeze reconstituted solutions, and protect from light. See our full guide on [Peptide Storage and Stability](/blog/peptide-storage-stability) for detailed protocols.

### Are there any drug interactions to be aware of?

All GLP-1 agonists slow gastric emptying, which can affect the absorption of oral medications. This is particularly relevant for medications with narrow therapeutic windows. Research protocols should account for potential interactions with co-administered compounds.
