If you've spent any time looking into growth hormone optimization, you've seen this pairing everywhere. CJC-1295 and Ipamorelin together. And there's a good reason it keeps showing up -- this combination is, in my experience, the cleanest and most effective way to drive meaningful GH pulses without the side-effect baggage that comes with older secretagogues.

But there's a lot of confusion floating around about which version of CJC-1295 to use, how to dose them, and what "growth hormone optimization" actually means in practice. So let's break it down.

*All information in this article is for educational and research purposes only. These peptides are research chemicals and are not FDA-approved for human use. Nothing here constitutes medical advice.*

## Why These Two Are Always Paired Together

Here's the short version: CJC-1295 and Ipamorelin work through completely different receptors, and when you combine them, you get a GH pulse that's significantly larger and cleaner than either one alone.

CJC-1295 is a growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) analog. It mimics the signal your body naturally sends to the pituitary gland telling it to produce and release growth hormone. Think of it as pressing the gas pedal.

Ipamorelin is a growth hormone secretagogue -- specifically, a ghrelin receptor agonist. It amplifies the GH release signal from a completely separate angle. Think of it as adding a turbocharger.

When you hit both pathways at once? The pituitary responds with a much bigger GH pulse than either signal could produce on its own. This is called synergistic amplification, and it's the entire reason this stack exists.

So why not just use a higher dose of one peptide? Because pushing a single pathway harder doesn't give the same result. You get diminishing returns and more side effects. Two moderate signals through different receptors outperform one large signal every time.

## CJC-1295: No DAC vs. With DAC (Mod GRF 1-29)

This is where things get confusing for people, and I don't blame them. There are essentially two versions of CJC-1295 being sold, and they behave very differently.

### CJC-1295 with DAC

The "DAC" stands for Drug Affinity Complex. This modification binds the peptide to albumin in the blood, extending its half-life to roughly 6-8 days. Sounds great on paper, right? Longer lasting, fewer injections.

The problem is that a multi-day elevation in GHRH signaling doesn't mimic the body's natural pulsatile GH release pattern. Instead of sharp, defined pulses of growth hormone (which is how your body naturally operates), you get a blunted, sustained elevation. This can lead to GH bleed -- a constant low-level elevation rather than the pronounced peaks that drive the beneficial effects. Most researchers I've talked to consider the DAC version suboptimal for this reason.

### CJC-1295 without DAC (Mod GRF 1-29)

This is the one you actually want. CJC-1295 no DAC -- also called Modified GRF 1-29 or simply Mod GRF -- has a half-life of about 30 minutes. It fires a quick, strong signal to the pituitary, triggers a clean GH pulse, and clears out. This preserves the body's natural pulsatile pattern.

The "modified" part refers to amino acid substitutions at positions 2, 8, 15, and 27 of the original GRF 1-29 sequence. These changes protect the peptide from rapid enzymatic breakdown, extending that 30-minute functional window (the original unmodified GRF 1-29 degrades in under 10 minutes). When you see "CJC-1295 no DAC" or "Mod GRF 1-29" from a vendor, they're referring to the same compound.

**Bottom line:** When building a CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin stack, go with the no-DAC version. This is the best option for mimicking natural GH physiology, period.

## Ipamorelin: The Selective Ghrelin Mimetic

Ipamorelin is a pentapeptide that acts as a selective growth hormone secretagogue. It binds to the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) in the pituitary, stimulating GH release.

Here's what makes Ipamorelin stand out from older GH secretagogues like GHRP-6 or GHRP-2: selectivity.

GHRP-6 is notorious for spiking cortisol, prolactin, and appetite (some researchers report ravenous hunger within 20 minutes of injection). GHRP-2 is better but still elevates cortisol and prolactin to some degree. Ipamorelin? In the published research, it stimulates GH release with minimal to no impact on cortisol, prolactin, or appetite. That's a massive advantage when you're trying to isolate GH effects in a research protocol.

It's also dose-dependent in a predictable way -- higher doses produce proportionally larger GH pulses up to the saturation point, without introducing new side effects. That kind of clean dose-response curve is exactly what you want in a research setting.

## Dosing Protocol

The standard research protocol for CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin is well established at this point. Here's what I've seen used most consistently across the community:

| Parameter | CJC-1295 (no DAC) | Ipamorelin |
|---|---|---|
| Dose per injection | 100 mcg | 100-200 mcg |
| Frequency | 1-3x daily | 1-3x daily |
| Administration | Subcutaneous | Subcutaneous |
| Cycle length | 8-12 weeks | 8-12 weeks |
| Off period | 4 weeks minimum | 4 weeks minimum |

Both peptides are administered together -- same syringe, same injection. No need to do separate shots.

A common three-times-daily schedule looks like this:

1. **Morning dose** (fasted, right after waking): 100mcg CJC + 100mcg Ipa
2. **Post-workout dose** (if training that day): 100mcg CJC + 100mcg Ipa
3. **Pre-bed dose** (at least 2 hours after last meal): 100mcg CJC + 200mcg Ipa

If three daily injections aren't practical, the pre-bed dose alone is the single most effective timing window. More on that below.

### Starting Conservative

For researchers new to GH peptides, starting with once daily (pre-bed) at 100mcg of each is a reasonable approach. After 2-3 weeks, you can assess the response and consider adding a morning dose if warranted. I've seen plenty of solid results from a twice-daily protocol -- three times daily isn't mandatory.

## Timing: Why Fasted and Pre-Bed Matters

Two rules for getting the most out of this stack.

**Rule 1: Inject on an empty stomach.** Elevated blood sugar and insulin directly suppress GH release. This isn't a minor effect -- it can reduce the GH pulse by 50% or more. Wait at least 2 hours after eating before your injection, and don't eat for 30-60 minutes after. This is one of those things that genuinely makes or breaks the protocol.

**Rule 2: The pre-bed dose is your most important one.** The body's largest natural GH pulse occurs during the first phase of deep sleep (typically within the first 1-2 hours of falling asleep). By injecting CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin 15-30 minutes before bed, you're amplifying a GH release that was going to happen anyway. You're riding the wave, not fighting against the body's circadian rhythm.

This is why researchers who can only inject once per day should choose the pre-bed window. It aligns with physiology in a way that morning dosing simply can't replicate.

## Pre-Made Blends vs. Individual Vials

You'll find vendors selling CJC-1295 and Ipamorelin as separate vials or as a pre-mixed blend in a single vial. Both approaches work, but there are trade-offs.

**Pre-made blends** are convenient. One vial, one reconstitution, one draw. The ratio is fixed (usually 1:1 at the standard dose), which eliminates dosing math errors. For researchers running the standard 100/100 protocol, blends are the easier path.

**Individual vials** give you flexibility. Want to run 100mcg CJC with 200mcg Ipa for the pre-bed dose? You'll need separate vials for that. They also let you adjust if you find one peptide works better at a different dose than the blend provides.

My take: if you're running a standard protocol for the first time, a blend is the simpler option. If you want to fine-tune your doses, buy them separately.

## Reconstitution

Both CJC-1295 and Ipamorelin come as lyophilized (freeze-dried) powders that need to be reconstituted with bacteriostatic water before use.

The process is the same as any other peptide:

1. Wipe both vial tops with an alcohol swab
2. Draw your desired volume of bacteriostatic water into a syringe
3. Inject the water slowly down the inside wall of the peptide vial -- don't blast the powder directly
4. Swirl gently until dissolved (never shake)
5. Label with the date and concentration

### Common Reconstitution Example

For a 5mg vial of CJC-1295 (no DAC) reconstituted with 2.5mL of BAC water:

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Vial size | 5 mg (5,000 mcg) |
| BAC water added | 2.5 mL |
| Concentration | 2,000 mcg/mL |
| Volume for 100 mcg dose | 0.05 mL (5 units on insulin syringe) |
| Doses per vial | 50 |

Same math applies to Ipamorelin vials.

## What to Expect from This Stack

Let me be upfront: CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin isn't going to turn you into a different person overnight. GH optimization is a slow burn. But the effects that researchers and self-experimenters consistently report are real and meaningful.

### Weeks 1-2: Better Sleep

This is usually the first thing people notice, and it's often dramatic. Deeper sleep, more vivid dreams, waking up feeling actually rested. The pre-bed dose amplifies the natural nocturnal GH pulse that governs deep sleep architecture. Some researchers report this within the first few days.

### Weeks 2-4: Recovery Improvements

Faster recovery from physical stress. Less soreness, quicker bounce-back between training sessions. This tracks with GH's role in tissue repair and protein synthesis. (If you're stacking with something like BPC-157 for a specific injury, this is where things get interesting -- see our [peptide stacking guide](/blog/peptide-stacking-guide).)

### Weeks 4-8: Body Composition Changes

This is where the real payoff shows up. Gradual fat loss (especially visceral and abdominal fat), improved skin quality, and in some cases, modest increases in lean mass. These changes accumulate over time -- it's not a dramatic overnight transformation, but by week 6-8 the difference becomes noticeable.

### Weeks 8-12: Full Protocol Benefits

By this point, the cumulative effects of sustained GH optimization are in full swing. Improved recovery capacity, favorable body composition changes, better sleep quality, and in many reports, improved mood and cognitive clarity. This is also a good time to start planning your off-cycle period.

### What NOT to Expect

This stack doesn't produce supraphysiological GH levels the way exogenous HGH injections do. You won't see the water retention, joint aches, or carpal tunnel symptoms associated with high-dose HGH. That's actually the point -- CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin works within the body's natural regulatory framework, amplifying your own GH production rather than overriding it.

## Cycle Length and Off-Periods

The standard recommendation is **8-12 weeks on, followed by at least 4 weeks off**.

Why cycle off? Two reasons.

First, there's the question of pituitary desensitization. Constant stimulation of GH release can, over time, reduce the pituitary's responsiveness to the signal. Taking a break allows receptor sensitivity to normalize.

Second, the off-period lets you assess what the stack actually did. Are you sleeping better? Did body composition change? How's your recovery? It's hard to evaluate the protocol's impact when you're still running it. The contrast between "on" and "off" gives you genuine data.

Some researchers run a 5-days-on, 2-days-off pattern throughout the cycle to mitigate desensitization while maintaining protocol momentum. This is a reasonable approach, though the standard continuous 8-12 week block remains more common in the research community.

## Storage

Follow the same storage principles you'd use for any reconstituted peptide:

- **Lyophilized (unreconstituted):** Store at -20C (freezer) for long-term, or 2-8C (refrigerator) for up to several months
- **Reconstituted:** Store at 2-8C (refrigerator), use within 28-30 days
- **Never freeze reconstituted peptides** -- freeze-thaw cycles degrade the peptide
- **Keep away from light** and always use a clean syringe when drawing

## Where to Buy CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin

Quality matters enormously with GH peptides. Underdosed or degraded product won't just give you bad results -- it'll give you no results, and you'll waste weeks wondering why the protocol isn't working.

Look for vendors that provide:

- Third-party certificates of analysis (COA) with HPLC purity verification at 98%+
- Proper lyophilized peptide in sealed, light-protected vials
- Clear labeling with peptide weight and lot numbers
- Consistent track record in the research community

I recommend **Peptide Restore** for sourcing research-grade CJC-1295 and Ipamorelin. They carry both individual vials and pre-made blends, and every batch ships with third-party testing documentation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I mix CJC-1295 and Ipamorelin in the same syringe?

Yes. These two peptides are chemically compatible and can be drawn into the same syringe for a single injection. Draw the CJC-1295 first, then the Ipamorelin (or vice versa -- order doesn't matter). Combine immediately before injection rather than pre-mixing in a vial for storage.

### What's the difference between CJC-1295 no DAC and Mod GRF 1-29?

They're the same thing. Mod GRF 1-29 (Modified GRF 1-29) is the technical name for CJC-1295 without the Drug Affinity Complex. Vendors use both names interchangeably. Just make sure you're not accidentally buying the DAC version, which has a much longer half-life and produces a different (generally less desirable) GH release pattern.

### How long before I notice effects?

Sleep improvements typically show up within the first week or two. Recovery benefits emerge around weeks 2-4. Body composition changes are the slowest to develop, usually becoming noticeable around weeks 6-8. Don't expect overnight results -- GH optimization is a cumulative process.

### Should I use this stack if I'm already on HGH?

Running CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin alongside exogenous HGH is generally considered redundant. Exogenous HGH directly elevates serum GH levels regardless of pituitary function, so stimulating the pituitary with secretagogues on top of that offers minimal additional benefit. Most researchers choose one approach or the other, not both.

### What about food timing -- how strict is the fasting rule?

Pretty strict, if you want optimal results. Elevated insulin and blood sugar significantly blunt the GH response to these peptides. Aim for at least a 2-hour gap after eating before you inject. The pre-bed dose naturally fits this requirement for most people who finish dinner a few hours before sleep.

### Can I use CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin for injury recovery?

While this stack primarily targets GH optimization (sleep, body composition, general recovery), GH itself plays a role in tissue repair. Some researchers combine this GH stack with dedicated repair peptides like BPC-157 for a more targeted approach. See our [BPC-157 guide](/blog/bpc-157-guide) and [peptide stacking guide](/blog/peptide-stacking-guide) for combination protocols.

### What's the best reconstitution volume for dosing convenience?

This depends on your vial size and target dose. For a 5mg vial where you want 100mcg per injection, reconstituting with 2.5mL gives you exactly 5 units per dose on a standard insulin syringe -- easy to measure accurately. Our [reconstitution calculator](/calculator) can show you the optimal volume for any setup.

### Are there side effects?

At standard research doses, side effects with this stack are uncommon and generally mild when they do occur. Occasionally reported effects include mild headache, flushing at the injection site, and (rarely) transient dizziness. The clean side-effect profile is a primary reason Ipamorelin is preferred over older secretagogues like GHRP-6 in modern protocols.
