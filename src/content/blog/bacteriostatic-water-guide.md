If you're getting into peptide research, bacteriostatic water is going to become your best friend. It's the solvent you'll use over and over again — every time you reconstitute a vial, every new protocol, every compound. And yet, This is a surprisingly common area where mistakes occur. Wrong water type, expired vials, sketchy storage habits. All of it leads to contaminated peptides and wasted money.

So let's break it down properly.

## What Exactly Is Bacteriostatic Water?

Bacteriostatic water (BAC water) is sterile water with one key addition: **0.9% benzyl alcohol**. That's it. No buffers, no salts, no magic ingredients. Just purified water and a preservative that stops bacteria from growing in the solution.

The benzyl alcohol is what makes it "bacteriostatic" — literally meaning "bacteria-stopping." It doesn't kill bacteria that are already present (that would be bactericidal), but it prevents new bacterial colonies from taking hold. This is critical when you're piercing a rubber stopper with a needle multiple times over the course of days or weeks.

Every time a needle goes through that stopper, there's a small chance of introducing contaminants. The benzyl alcohol is your safety net.

## BAC Water vs. Sterile Water vs. Normal Saline

This is where people get confused, so I'll keep it simple.

**Bacteriostatic water** — Sterile water + 0.9% benzyl alcohol. The standard for peptide reconstitution. Multi-use over 2-4 weeks. This is what you want for almost every situation.

**Sterile water** — Pure water, no preservative whatsoever. Once you open it or puncture the vial, bacteria can start growing immediately. Use it within 24 hours, period. Some researchers use sterile water for single-dose applications or for cell culture work where benzyl alcohol might interfere, but for routine peptide reconstitution? BAC water wins every time.

**Normal saline (0.9% NaCl)** — Sterile water with salt. Used in clinical and veterinary settings for IV infusions and wound irrigation. Not typically used for peptide reconstitution unless a specific protocol calls for it.

**Bacteriostatic normal saline** — Saline with benzyl alcohol preservative. Occasionally used, but BAC water is the default for peptides.

So why does this matter? Because if you grab a vial of plain sterile water and use it to reconstitute a peptide you plan to dose from over the next three weeks, you're setting yourself up for bacterial contamination. The peptide itself might be fine, but the solution it's sitting in becomes a petri dish without that preservative.

## Why Benzyl Alcohol Is Non-Negotiable for Multi-Dose Vials

Let me put this in practical terms. Say you reconstitute a 5 mg vial of BPC-157 with 2 mL of BAC water. You're planning to draw from that vial daily for about 20 days. That's 20 needle punctures through the rubber stopper, each one a potential entry point for airborne bacteria or contaminants on the needle.

Without benzyl alcohol, bacterial colonies can begin forming within hours of contamination. Within a few days, you might have visible cloudiness — or worse, invisible contamination that degrades your peptide without any obvious signs.

With benzyl alcohol, those bacteria can't multiply. The preservative holds the line for the usable life of the vial (typically 28-30 days after first puncture).

It's cheap insurance. Don't skip it.

## Shelf Life: Unopened vs. Opened

This trips people up constantly.

**Unopened BAC water** has a long shelf life — typically 2-3 years from the date of manufacture, as long as it's stored properly (room temperature, out of direct sunlight, sealed). Check the expiration date printed on the vial. If it's past that date, toss it.

**Once you puncture the vial**, the clock starts. The general rule is **28-30 days from the first needle puncture**. After that, the benzyl alcohol's preservative action becomes less reliable, and contamination risk increases. Some sources say you can push it a bit longer, but 30 days is a widely accepted hard cutoff. Write the date on the vial when you first open it.

Here's a quick reference:

| Condition | Shelf Life |
|---|---|
| Unopened, room temperature | Until expiration date (typically 2-3 years) |
| Opened, stored properly | 28-30 days from first puncture |
| Expired (past printed date) | Discard — don't risk it |

## How to Use BAC Water for Peptide Reconstitution

I won't rehash the entire reconstitution process here — we've got a [full step-by-step reconstitution guide](/blog/how-to-reconstitute-peptides) that covers it in detail. But here's the short version:

1. **Swab everything.** Alcohol wipe on the BAC water vial stopper and the peptide vial stopper. Let them air dry for a few seconds.
2. **Draw your BAC water.** Use a clean syringe (1-3 mL) to pull out the volume you've decided on. Common choices are 1 mL or 2 mL per peptide vial.
3. **Inject slowly into the peptide vial.** Aim the stream against the glass wall, not directly onto the powder. Let the water trickle down and pool at the bottom.
4. **Swirl gently.** Never shake. Tilt the vial and roll it between your fingers until the powder dissolves completely. If it doesn't dissolve right away, set it in the fridge for 20-30 minutes and check again.
5. **Label and refrigerate.** Write the peptide name, date, concentration, and volume on the vial. Store at 2-8°C.

## Storage: Where to Keep Your BAC Water

BAC water is pretty forgiving compared to reconstituted peptides. You've got two options:

**Room temperature** is perfectly fine for sealed, unopened vials. Keep them out of direct sunlight and away from heat sources. A drawer, cabinet, or shelf works great.

**Refrigeration** is optional but won't hurt. Some researchers prefer to keep their BAC water in the fridge alongside their reconstituted peptides just to keep everything in one place. Totally fine — the benzyl alcohol won't be affected by cold temperatures.

The main things to avoid: direct sunlight, extreme heat (don't leave it in a hot car), and a compromised seal. If the stopper looks damaged or the crimp cap is loose, don't use it.

## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

These are all common errors that compromise peptide integrity.

**Using expired BAC water.** Check the date. Every time. Expired BAC water may have reduced benzyl alcohol concentration, meaning less bacterial protection. It's not worth the risk on a $40-60 peptide vial.

**Using tap water or distilled water from the grocery store.** Look, I shouldn't have to say this, but I've seen it asked in forums. Tap water is full of chlorine, minerals, and microorganisms. Distilled water from the store isn't sterile — it's just mineral-free. Neither is appropriate for reconstituting research peptides. Use pharmaceutical-grade BAC water. Period.

**Not swabbing the stopper before drawing.** Every. Single. Time. Even if you just swabbed it five minutes ago. Alcohol swabs cost fractions of a penny. Contaminated peptides cost real money.

**Reusing syringes to draw from the BAC water vial.** Use a fresh, clean syringe each time. Cross-contamination between your peptide vial and your BAC water vial defeats the whole purpose of the preservative.

**Storing opened BAC water for months.** Thirty days. That's your window after first puncture. Regardless of remaining volume — if it's been open for two months, start fresh.

## Can You Make Your Own Bacteriostatic Water?

No. And I really mean that.

Yes, you can find recipes online telling you to mix benzyl alcohol into distilled water. But here's the problem: you can't achieve pharmaceutical-grade sterility in a home or garage lab. Commercial BAC water is manufactured in ISO-certified cleanrooms, filtered through 0.22-micron membranes, and tested for endotoxins and particulate matter. Your kitchen counter doesn't qualify.

The risk of introducing contaminants — bacteria, endotoxins, particulate matter — far outweighs the few dollars you'd save. A 30 mL vial of BAC water costs around $5-8. Just buy it.

## How Much BAC Water Do You Actually Need?

This depends on how many peptide vials you're working with and how much water you add to each. Here's a rough guide:

Most researchers add **1-2 mL of BAC water per peptide vial**. A standard BAC water vial comes in 30 mL. So one 30 mL vial gives you enough to reconstitute roughly **15-30 peptide vials** (at 1-2 mL each).

If you're running a single compound — say BPC-157 at one vial per month — a single 30 mL BAC water vial will last you through several peptide vials (and you'll hit the 30-day expiration before you run out of water). But if you're running multiple compounds simultaneously, you might go through BAC water faster.

Best practice: keep at least two vials on hand. One in use, one backup. Running out mid-protocol is annoying. You can always grab more from [Peptide Restore — 5% off with code DKE4PDRM](https://peptiderestore.com?discount=DKE4PDRM).

## Where to Buy Bacteriostatic Water

You want pharmaceutical-grade BAC water from a reputable source. Not eBay. Not some random Amazon seller with no reviews. This is a product where quality control actually matters — if the sterility is compromised during manufacturing, the preservative is irrelevant because you're starting with a contaminated product.

What to look for:

- **USP-grade** designation (United States Pharmacopeia standards)
- **Sealed vials** with intact crimp caps and rubber stoppers
- **Clear expiration dates** printed on the label
- **Certificate of analysis** available on request
- **30 mL vials** are the standard size (some suppliers also sell 10 mL)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does bacteriostatic water need to be refrigerated?

Unopened, no — room temperature is fine. Once opened, refrigeration is recommended but not strictly required. The benzyl alcohol preserves the water at either temperature. That said, most researchers keep it in the fridge for convenience since reconstituted peptides need refrigeration anyway.

### Can I use bacteriostatic water after 30 days?

I wouldn't. The 28-30 day guideline after first puncture exists because the preservative's effectiveness diminishes over time, especially with repeated needle punctures introducing micro-contaminants. It's a cheap product — just open a fresh vial.

### Is benzyl alcohol safe?

At the 0.9% concentration used in BAC water, benzyl alcohol has a long safety profile in pharmaceutical applications. It's been used as a preservative in injectable medications for decades. The only notable exception is neonatal research, where benzyl alcohol is avoided due to toxicity concerns in very small subjects (sometimes called "gasping syndrome" in historical literature).

### What's the difference between 0.9% and 0.9% — BAC water vs. normal saline?

Easy to confuse these. BAC water contains 0.9% **benzyl alcohol** (a preservative). Normal saline contains 0.9% **sodium chloride** (salt). Completely different substances, completely different purposes. BAC water is for reconstitution. Normal saline is for dilution and infusion in clinical contexts.

### Can I use BAC water for anything other than peptides?

BAC water is used broadly as a diluent for various injectable research compounds, not just peptides. It's also used in pharmaceutical compounding for reconstituting lyophilized medications. But for our purposes — peptide research — it's the standard solvent for turning freeze-dried powder into a usable solution.

### How do I know if my BAC water has gone bad?

Inspect it visually. Fresh BAC water is completely clear and colorless with no visible particles. If you see cloudiness, floaters, discoloration, or anything that looks "off," discard it immediately. Also check that the rubber stopper hasn't been compromised and that the vial isn't past its expiration date.

### How much BAC water should I add to my peptide vial?

There's no universal answer — it depends on the peptide amount and your target concentration. Adding more water creates a more dilute solution (more units per dose on your syringe). Adding less water creates a more concentrated solution (fewer units per dose). Most people use 1-2 mL. Our [peptide reconstitution calculator](/calculator) will help you figure out the ideal volume for your specific setup.

## The Bottom Line

Bacteriostatic water isn't glamorous, but it's the foundation of every peptide protocol. Get the right stuff (pharmaceutical-grade, USP), store it properly, respect the 30-day window after opening, and always swab before drawing. It's one of those things where cutting corners saves you pennies but can cost you the entire vial of peptide you're reconstituting.
