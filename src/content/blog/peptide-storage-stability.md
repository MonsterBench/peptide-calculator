# Peptide Storage & Stability Guide: How to Store Peptides Properly

Knowing **how to store peptides** correctly is just as important as calculating the right dosage. Improper storage is one of the most common reasons researchers encounter inconsistent results, reduced potency, and outright waste of expensive compounds. Whether you are working with lyophilized powder or a reconstituted solution, the conditions you maintain -- temperature, light exposure, container choice, and solvent type -- directly determine how long your peptides remain viable.

This guide covers everything you need to know about **peptide stability**, from long-term freezer storage of unreconstituted vials to the practical shelf life of reconstituted solutions in your refrigerator.

## Why Peptide Storage Matters

Peptides are chains of amino acids held together by peptide bonds. These bonds, along with the three-dimensional folding of the molecule, are sensitive to heat, oxidation, microbial contamination, and repeated freeze-thaw cycles. When storage conditions are poor, several forms of degradation can occur:

- **Hydrolysis** -- Water molecules attack peptide bonds, breaking the chain into inactive fragments.
- **Oxidation** -- Exposure to air oxidizes methionine, tryptophan, and cysteine residues, altering the peptide's structure and function.
- **Aggregation** -- Temperature fluctuations cause peptides to clump together, reducing solubility and bioactivity.
- **Microbial contamination** -- Bacteria introduced during reconstitution multiply in solution, degrading the peptide and introducing endotoxins.

The practical result is simple: a peptide stored incorrectly may lose 50% or more of its potency within days, while the same peptide stored properly can remain stable for weeks or even years. That's a massive difference -- and the fix is straightforward.

## Lyophilized (Unreconstituted) Peptide Storage

Lyophilized peptides -- the dry, powdered form you receive from a supplier -- are the most stable form of any peptide. The freeze-drying process removes virtually all water, which eliminates hydrolysis as a degradation pathway.

**Best practices for lyophilized storage:**

- **Store at -20 C or colder.** A standard laboratory freezer at -20 C is ideal for storage up to 2-3 years. For archival storage beyond that, -80 C is preferred.
- **Keep vials sealed.** Do not puncture the rubber stopper until you are ready to reconstitute. The vacuum or inert gas atmosphere inside the vial protects against oxidation.
- **Minimize freeze-thaw exposure.** If you remove a vial from the freezer, allow it to reach room temperature before opening to prevent condensation from forming inside the vial. Moisture is the enemy of lyophilized peptides.
- **Use desiccant packs** in your storage container as an additional layer of moisture protection.

Under these conditions, most lyophilized peptides maintain greater than 95% purity for 24 months or longer.

## Reconstituted Peptide Storage

Once you add solvent to a lyophilized peptide, the stability clock starts ticking much faster. The presence of water reactivates hydrolysis and creates an environment where bacteria can grow. How you handle reconstituted peptides determines whether they last 5 days or 5 weeks.

If you need help calculating the correct solvent volume for your concentration needs, use our [peptide reconstitution calculator](/calculator) for precise measurements.

**Best practices for reconstituted storage:**

- **Refrigerate at 2-8 C (36-46 F).** A standard household or laboratory refrigerator is appropriate. Never store reconstituted peptides at room temperature.
- **Use bacteriostatic water (BAC water) as your solvent** whenever possible. The 0.9% benzyl alcohol preservative inhibits microbial growth and extends shelf life significantly compared to sterile water.
- **Keep vials upright** to minimize the surface area of liquid exposed to the gas headspace in the vial.
- **Avoid repeated needle punctures.** Each time you pierce the stopper, you introduce a small amount of air and potential contaminants. Draw multiple doses if practical, or use a designated multi-dose protocol.
- **Do not freeze reconstituted peptides** unless the specific peptide is validated for freeze-thaw stability. Ice crystal formation can denature many peptide structures.

## Temperature Guide for Peptide Storage

The following table summarizes recommended storage temperatures based on peptide form and intended duration of storage.

| Condition | Lyophilized (Powder) | Reconstituted (Solution) |
|---|---|---|
| **Room temperature (20-25 C)** | Acceptable for short transit (days). Avoid prolonged exposure. | Not recommended. Rapid degradation within 24-72 hours. |
| **Refrigerated (2-8 C)** | Stable for 3-6 months. Suitable for frequently accessed vials. | Recommended. Stable for 2-4 weeks with BAC water; 3-7 days with sterile water. |
| **Frozen (-20 C)** | Ideal for long-term storage. Stable for 2+ years. | Not generally recommended. Some peptides tolerate a single freeze, but repeated freeze-thaw degrades most compounds. |
| **Deep frozen (-80 C)** | Archival storage. Stable for 5+ years. | Only for validated peptides with cryoprotectant. |

**Key takeaway:** Lyophilized peptides are forgiving. Reconstituted peptides are not. Once you've reconstituted, refrigerate immediately and plan to use the solution within the stability window for that specific compound.

## Light and Air Protection

Ultraviolet light and oxygen are two of the biggest threats to peptide integrity -- and they're easy to overlook.

**Light protection:**

- Many peptides, particularly those containing tryptophan, tyrosine, or phenylalanine residues, are photosensitive. UV light triggers oxidation and bond cleavage in these residues.
- Store all peptide vials in opaque containers, amber vials, or wrapped in aluminum foil.
- Do not leave reconstituted vials sitting on a countertop or bench under fluorescent or LED lighting for extended periods during use.

**Air (oxygen) protection:**

- After reconstituting, minimize the headspace in the vial. If you have drawn out a significant volume of solution, the remaining liquid is now exposed to a larger air pocket.
- Some researchers backfill vials with nitrogen or argon gas after each use to displace oxygen. While not strictly necessary for short-term storage, this is a best practice for peptides you plan to use over several weeks.
- Always ensure the rubber stopper is fully seated and hasn't been compromised by repeated punctures.

## How to Travel with Peptides

Researchers occasionally need to transport peptides between laboratories or during field work. Temperature control during transit is the primary concern.

**For lyophilized peptides:**

- Lyophilized vials can tolerate room temperature for several days without significant degradation. Standard shipping without cold packs is acceptable for transit times under 5 days.
- For added protection or hot climates, use an insulated pouch with a single cold pack.

**For reconstituted peptides:**

- Use an insulated cooler bag with ice packs or gel packs to maintain 2-8 C.
- Avoid placing vials in direct contact with ice packs, as localized freezing can damage the peptide. Wrap vials in paper towels or bubble wrap for insulation.
- Keep vials upright to prevent leakage around the stopper.
- For air travel, pack in checked luggage within a hard-sided cooler if possible. TSA generally permits medical and research vials, but carry documentation from your supplier if available.
- Plan your transit time. Reconstituted peptides should not be out of refrigeration for more than 4-6 hours.

## Signs of Peptide Degradation

Knowing when a peptide has gone bad prevents wasted time and unreliable data. Watch for these indicators:

- **Cloudiness or turbidity** -- A reconstituted solution that was previously clear but has turned cloudy likely contains aggregated peptide, bacterial growth, or both. Discard immediately.
- **Particulate matter** -- Visible particles or floaters in solution indicate degradation or contamination.
- **Color change** -- Most peptide solutions are clear and colorless. Yellowing or browning suggests oxidation.
- **Unusual odor** -- A foul smell upon opening the vial indicates bacterial contamination.
- **Reduced efficacy in assays** -- If your research results suddenly become inconsistent or show reduced potency with the same protocol, degraded peptide is a likely culprit.
- **Difficulty dissolving** -- If a lyophilized peptide that previously dissolved easily now leaves residue or clumps, it may have absorbed moisture and partially degraded during storage.

When in doubt, toss it and reconstitute a fresh vial. The cost of a new vial is far less than the cost of compromised research results.

## Storage by Peptide Type

Different peptides have varying degrees of stability once reconstituted. The table below provides general guidance for common research peptides stored at 2-8 C in bacteriostatic water.

| Peptide | Reconstituted Shelf Life (BAC Water, 2-8 C) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **BPC-157** | 3-4 weeks | Relatively stable. Keep away from light. See our [BPC-157 research guide](/blog/bpc-157-guide). |
| **TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4)** | 2-3 weeks | Moderate stability. Avoid freeze-thaw. |
| **CJC-1295 (with DAC)** | 3-4 weeks | The DAC modification improves stability. |
| **CJC-1295 (no DAC / Mod GRF 1-29)** | 1-2 weeks | Less stable without DAC. Use promptly. |
| **Ipamorelin** | 3-4 weeks | Good stability profile. |
| **GHK-Cu** | 2-3 weeks | Copper complex adds some stability. Protect from light. |
| **Semaglutide** | 4-6 weeks | Excellent stability due to albumin binding and acylation. |
| **PT-141 (Bremelanotide)** | 2-3 weeks | Moderate stability. Standard storage. |
| **DSIP (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide)** | 1-2 weeks | Shorter shelf life. Reconstitute in smaller batches. |
| **Epithalon (Epitalon)** | 2-3 weeks | Standard stability. No special requirements beyond general guidelines. |
| **Sermorelin** | 2-3 weeks | Moderate stability. Refrigerate immediately after reconstitution. |
| **AOD-9604** | 2-3 weeks | Standard handling. Protect from light. |

*Note: These are general estimates based on commonly reported stability data. Actual shelf life may vary depending on purity, solvent quality, and handling practices. Always refer to the certificate of analysis (COA) from your supplier for specific storage recommendations.*

## Bacteriostatic Water vs. Sterile Water for Reconstitution

The solvent you choose has a direct impact on **reconstituted peptide shelf life**. Understanding the difference is critical.

**Bacteriostatic water (BAC water):**

- Contains 0.9% benzyl alcohol as a preservative.
- Inhibits bacterial growth, making it suitable for multi-dose vials that will be accessed repeatedly over days or weeks.
- Extends reconstituted shelf life to 2-4+ weeks for most peptides.
- The industry standard for research peptide reconstitution.

**Sterile water:**

- Contains no preservatives.
- Suitable for single-use applications where the entire vial contents are used immediately.
- Reconstituted peptides in sterile water should be used within 3-7 days maximum, stored at 2-8 C.
- Each needle puncture introduces contamination risk with no preservative to compensate.

**Recommendation:** Unless you have a specific reason to avoid benzyl alcohol (such as sensitivity testing in certain cell culture assays), always reconstitute with bacteriostatic water.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long can reconstituted peptides last in the refrigerator?

When reconstituted with bacteriostatic water and stored at 2-8 C, most peptides remain stable for 2-4 weeks. With sterile water, shelf life drops to 3-7 days. Always inspect for signs of degradation before use. Refer to the peptide-specific table above for compound-level estimates.

### Can I freeze reconstituted peptides to make them last longer?

Freezing reconstituted peptides is generally not recommended. Ice crystal formation during freezing can disrupt the peptide's tertiary structure and cause irreversible aggregation. If you must freeze, do so only once, use a cryoprotectant if validated for your peptide, and thaw slowly at 2-8 C. Never refreeze.

### How do I know if my lyophilized peptide has degraded?

Check the appearance of the powder. Fresh lyophilized peptide is typically a fluffy white or off-white cake or powder. If it appears wet, clumped, discolored, or has collapsed from its original lyophilized structure, moisture ingress or thermal degradation may have occurred. When reconstituted, degraded peptide may not dissolve fully or may produce a cloudy solution.

### Does it matter what type of vial I store reconstituted peptides in?

Yes. Amber glass vials provide the best protection against UV-induced degradation. Clear glass vials wrapped in aluminum foil are an acceptable alternative. Avoid plastic containers, as some peptides can adsorb to plastic surfaces, reducing effective concentration over time.

### How should I store peptides if I do not have a laboratory freezer?

A standard household freezer (-18 to -20 C) is perfectly adequate for lyophilized peptide storage. For reconstituted peptides, any refrigerator that maintains 2-8 C will work. One tip that's easy to overlook: avoid storing vials in the refrigerator door, where temperatures fluctuate each time the door opens. Place them toward the back of a shelf for the most consistent temperature.

### What is the best way to calculate my reconstitution volume?

Use our [peptide reconstitution calculator](/calculator) to determine exactly how much bacteriostatic water to add based on your peptide quantity and desired concentration per unit volume.
