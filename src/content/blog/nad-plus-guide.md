NAD+ has gone from obscure biochemistry footnote to the single most talked-about molecule in longevity research. And unlike a lot of anti-aging hype, this one actually has serious science behind it. We're talking thousands of published papers, multiple ongoing clinical trials, and some of the most respected researchers in the aging field staking their careers on it.

But here's the thing -- most of the content out there either oversimplifies NAD+ into useless buzzwords or buries you in molecular biology jargon. I want to land somewhere in the middle. Enough depth to actually understand what's going on, enough practicality to design a real research protocol.

## What NAD+ Actually Does

NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a coenzyme found in every single cell of your body. It's not some exotic compound -- it's one of the most fundamental molecules in human biology. Without it, you'd be dead in about 30 seconds.

At the most basic level, NAD+ is an electron carrier. It shuttles electrons between molecules during metabolic reactions, which is how your cells convert food into usable energy (ATP). Every time your mitochondria produce energy, NAD+ is involved. Every time a cell repairs damaged DNA, NAD+ is involved. Every time your body activates its stress-response pathways, NAD+ is involved.

It's not a supplement that does one thing. It's a foundational molecule that hundreds of biological processes depend on to function at all.

### The Three Big Roles

**1. Energy production (mitochondrial function)**

NAD+ is essential for the electron transport chain -- the final step of cellular respiration where the majority of ATP gets produced. When NAD+ levels drop, mitochondrial efficiency drops with it. Less energy output, more oxidative waste. Cells start struggling with their basic metabolic functions.

**2. DNA repair (PARP enzymes)**

PARPs (poly ADP-ribose polymerases) are enzymes that detect and repair single-strand DNA breaks. They're critically important -- your DNA sustains tens of thousands of lesions per cell per day from normal metabolic activity alone. PARPs consume NAD+ as fuel to do their repair work. When NAD+ is scarce, DNA damage accumulates faster than it can be fixed.

**3. Longevity pathway activation (sirtuins)**

This is the one that got everyone's attention. Sirtuins are a family of seven proteins (SIRT1-SIRT7) that regulate aging at the cellular level. They control gene expression, inflammation, mitochondrial biogenesis, stress resistance, and cell survival. And they're entirely dependent on NAD+ to function.

Without adequate NAD+, sirtuins can't do their job. It's that simple.

## Why NAD+ Declines With Age

Here's the part that makes this personally relevant to anyone over 30.

NAD+ levels decline dramatically as you age. By age 50, you've lost roughly half the NAD+ you had at age 20. By 80, levels are down to about 1-10% of youthful concentrations in some tissues. This isn't subtle -- it's a steep, consistent decline that correlates tightly with the onset of age-related diseases.

Why does this happen? Multiple factors working simultaneously:

**CD38 overexpression.** CD38 is an enzyme that breaks down NAD+. Its expression increases with age, and in chronic low-grade inflammation (which virtually everyone develops as they age), CD38 activity skyrockets. One study found that CD38 is the primary driver of age-related NAD+ decline -- more than any other factor.

**Increased PARP activity.** As you age, DNA damage accumulates. More damage means more PARP activation. More PARP activation means more NAD+ consumption for repair work. It's a vicious cycle: aging causes more DNA damage, which burns through more NAD+, which impairs the repair mechanisms that depend on NAD+.

**Declining biosynthesis.** Your body makes its own NAD+ through several pathways (the salvage pathway being the most important). These biosynthetic pathways become less efficient with age, so you're producing less NAD+ at the same time you're consuming and degrading more of it.

**Chronic inflammation.** Low-grade systemic inflammation -- sometimes called "inflammaging" -- activates NAD+-consuming immune pathways. The inflammatory signaling itself burns through NAD+ reserves.

The result is a compounding deficit. Less NAD+ means less DNA repair, less mitochondrial function, less sirtuin activity, more inflammation, more DNA damage, and further NAD+ depletion. It's the biological definition of a downward spiral.

## Routes of Administration

Not all NAD+ delivery methods are equal. This is where the research gets practically important.

### IV NAD+

Intravenous NAD+ delivers the molecule directly into the bloodstream, bypassing digestion entirely. This produces the most immediate and measurable spike in blood NAD+ levels.

The catch? IV NAD+ infusions typically take 2-4 hours (sometimes longer), can cause significant flushing, chest tightness, nausea, and cramping during administration, and need to be performed in a clinical setting. They're also expensive -- a typical session runs $250-750.

Some clinics offer faster "push" protocols at lower doses, but the side effect profile during infusion is a real barrier for regular use. That said, researchers who use IV NAD+ often report the most pronounced acute effects.

### Subcutaneous NAD+

This is the route that's gained the most traction in the research community over the past couple of years. Subcutaneous injection delivers NAD+ directly into the tissue just under the skin, where it's absorbed into the bloodstream over a period of hours.

Compared to IV, subcutaneous NAD+ is:
- Self-administrable (no clinic visit needed)
- Much faster to prepare and inject (under 5 minutes)
- Generally better tolerated (less acute flushing and discomfort)
- Significantly cheaper per dose

The trade-off is that absorption is slower and peak blood levels may be lower than IV. But for a multi-times-per-week protocol, subcutaneous is far more practical. And frankly, consistency over time matters more than any single peak. A researcher who injects subcutaneously three times a week for months will likely see better cumulative results than someone who does one IV session per month.

### Oral Precursors: NMN and NR

Rather than taking NAD+ directly, oral precursors like NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) and NR (nicotinamide riboside) give the body building blocks to synthesize its own NAD+.

NMN is one enzymatic step away from NAD+ in the salvage pathway. NR is two steps away. Both have clinical data showing they can raise blood NAD+ levels, though the magnitude of increase and tissue-specific distribution are still being studied.

The oral route is the most convenient by far. Pop a capsule, done. But there are legitimate questions about bioavailability -- how much actually survives digestion, gets absorbed, enters cells, and converts to NAD+ where it's needed. Some studies show meaningful increases in blood NAD+; others show more modest effects. The delivery form matters too (sublingual NMN appears to have better absorption than standard capsules in some data).

Look, oral NMN/NR is better than nothing. But if you want the most direct and measurable impact on NAD+ levels, injectable NAD+ (particularly subcutaneous) is the stronger option based on current evidence.

## Subcutaneous NAD+ Dosing Protocol

For researchers working with injectable NAD+, here's the protocol framework that I've seen used most consistently:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Dose | 50-100 mg per injection |
| Frequency | 2-3 times per week |
| Route | Subcutaneous |
| Cycle length | 8-12 weeks |
| Off period | 4 weeks (optional -- some researchers run continuous) |

### Starting Protocol

New researchers typically start at 50mg subcutaneously, 2x per week. This allows assessment of tolerance (some people experience mild stinging at the injection site, temporary flushing, or a brief sensation of warmth). After 1-2 weeks, the dose can be increased to 100mg if well tolerated, and frequency can move to 3x per week.

### Injection Notes

NAD+ solution can sting more than typical peptide injections. A few things that help:

- Inject slowly (over 30-60 seconds rather than a quick push)
- Let the solution come to room temperature before injecting
- Rotate injection sites -- abdomen, thigh, upper arm
- Some researchers dilute with a small amount of bacteriostatic water to reduce concentration at the injection site

Use our [Peptide Reconstitution Calculator](/calculator) for precise dilution volumes based on your source concentration and target dose.

### What to Expect

**Week 1-2:** Improved energy levels and mental clarity are commonly reported early on. Better sustained focus throughout the day, less of that 2pm energy crash. Some researchers report improved mood.

**Week 3-4:** Sleep quality improvements tend to emerge here. More restorative sleep, easier time waking up. Physical recovery from exercise may improve as well.

**Week 6-8:** This is where the cumulative cellular effects start compounding. Skin quality improvements, better exercise capacity, sustained energy that feels qualitatively different from stimulant-driven alertness. Some researchers running blood panels report improvements in inflammatory markers.

**Month 3+:** Researchers on longer protocols report the most significant and sustained benefits in this timeframe. The effects of restored mitochondrial function and sirtuin activity take time to manifest at the tissue and systemic level.

## The NAD+ and GHK-Cu Anti-Aging Stack

One of the most interesting combination protocols in longevity research pairs NAD+ with GHK-Cu (copper tripeptide). The rationale is elegant: NAD+ addresses aging at the intracellular level (mitochondria, DNA repair, sirtuins), while GHK-Cu addresses aging at the extracellular level (collagen remodeling, tissue architecture, gene expression).

| Compound | Role | Typical Dose |
|---|---|---|
| NAD+ | Mitochondrial function, sirtuin activation, DNA repair | 50-100mg subcutaneous, 2-3x/week |
| GHK-Cu | Collagen synthesis, gene expression modulation (4,000+ genes), antioxidant enzyme activation | 1-2mg subcutaneous, daily |

GHK-Cu is a naturally occurring tripeptide that declines with age (from about 200 ng/mL in plasma at age 20 to 80 ng/mL by age 60). It's been shown to activate genes associated with tissue repair while suppressing genes linked to inflammation and tissue breakdown. The copper ion it carries is essential for numerous enzymatic processes in wound healing and tissue remodeling.

Together, these two compounds represent a two-pronged approach: restore the cellular energy and repair capacity from the inside (NAD+), and rebuild the structural tissue architecture from the outside (GHK-Cu).

## Storage Considerations

NAD+ requires more careful storage attention than most peptides.

### Lyophilized NAD+

- Store at -20C (freezer) for maximum long-term stability
- Protect from light -- NAD+ is photosensitive and degrades under UV exposure
- Properly stored lyophilized NAD+ can last 12-24 months

### Reconstituted NAD+

- Refrigerate at 2-8C immediately after reconstitution
- Use within 14-21 days (NAD+ in solution is less stable than most reconstituted peptides)
- Keep the vial wrapped in foil or stored in a dark container -- light exposure accelerates degradation
- If the solution develops any yellow discoloration, it's oxidizing and should be discarded
- Use bacteriostatic water for reconstitution to prevent microbial growth

The shorter post-reconstitution shelf life is worth noting. Unlike BPC-157 or Ipamorelin, which are generally good for 28-30 days reconstituted, NAD+ in solution starts losing potency faster. Plan your reconstitution volumes accordingly -- don't reconstitute more than you'll use in two to three weeks.

## NAD+ vs. NMN vs. NR: Which Should You Use?

This is the question everyone asks. Here's how I think about it.

**NAD+ (injectable)** is the direct approach. You're putting the actual molecule into your system. Highest certainty that you're raising NAD+ levels, most data on acute blood-level changes. The downside is that it requires injections and has a shorter shelf life in solution.

**NMN (oral or sublingual)** is one conversion step away from NAD+. David Sinclair's lab at Harvard has championed NMN research extensively. Good oral bioavailability data is emerging, especially for sublingual forms. It's convenient and widely available, but you're relying on enzymatic conversion to get from NMN to NAD+. Typical research doses are 250-500mg daily.

**NR (oral)** is two conversion steps from NAD+. It was the first NAD+ precursor to gain mainstream attention (sold commercially as Niagen). It has solid clinical trial data showing blood NAD+ increases, though the magnitude of tissue-level NAD+ restoration compared to NMN or direct NAD+ is still debated. Typical research doses are 300-1000mg daily.

So which one? If you want maximum certainty and don't mind injections, subcutaneous NAD+ is the strongest option. If you want convenience and are comfortable with indirect NAD+ elevation, sublingual NMN is a solid choice with growing evidence behind it. NR works too, but I'd put it third in line based on current data.

And honestly? Some researchers use both -- injectable NAD+ 2-3x per week plus daily oral NMN on the off-days. Belt and suspenders approach. Not a bad strategy if the budget allows.

## Where to Buy Research-Grade NAD+

Sourcing quality NAD+ is critical. Because NAD+ is less stable than many peptides, quality control during manufacturing, shipping, and storage is even more important. Degraded NAD+ won't hurt you, but it won't do anything useful either.

When evaluating vendors, look for:

- Third-party COA (certificate of analysis) confirming identity and purity
- Proper lyophilization and light-protected packaging
- Cold-chain shipping (especially in warm months)
- Transparent lot numbering and expiration dating

**Peptide Restore** carries research-grade NAD+ with third-party testing and proper cold-chain handling. They're my go-to recommendation for this compound.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly does NAD+ work?

Subjective effects like improved energy and mental clarity are commonly reported within the first 1-2 weeks of a subcutaneous protocol. However, the deeper cellular benefits (DNA repair, mitochondrial optimization, sirtuin-mediated gene expression changes) accumulate over months. Think of it as an investment -- the longer you maintain adequate NAD+ levels, the more the benefits compound.

### Does NAD+ actually reverse aging?

"Reverse" is a strong word. What the research shows is that restoring NAD+ levels to more youthful concentrations reactivates cellular maintenance and repair pathways that had become impaired due to NAD+ depletion. Whether that constitutes "reversal" or "slowing" of aging depends on your definition. What's clear is that NAD+ depletion is a driver of age-related decline, and restoring it measurably improves cellular function in both animal models and emerging human data.

### Is subcutaneous NAD+ painful?

It can sting more than a typical peptide injection. The sensation is usually a brief burning at the injection site that fades within a few minutes. Injecting slowly, warming the solution to room temperature, and rotating sites all help. Most researchers report the discomfort is manageable and decreases as they adjust to the protocol.

### Can I combine NAD+ with other peptides?

Absolutely. NAD+ stacks well with several research compounds. The GHK-Cu combination for anti-aging is covered above. Some researchers also combine NAD+ with CJC-1295 + Ipamorelin for a protocol that addresses both cellular energy metabolism and growth hormone optimization. Check our [peptide stacking guide](/blog/peptide-stacking-guide) for more combination protocols.

### How is NAD+ reconstituted?

Same general process as any lyophilized research compound -- add bacteriostatic water slowly along the vial wall, swirl gently, never shake. The key difference is shelf life: use reconstituted NAD+ within 14-21 days and keep it protected from light at all times. See our full [reconstitution guide](/blog/how-to-reconstitute-peptides) for step-by-step instructions, or use the [calculator](/calculator) to determine your volumes.

### What's the difference between NAD+ and NADH?

NAD+ is the oxidized form; NADH is the reduced form. They're two states of the same molecule, constantly cycling back and forth during metabolic reactions. NAD+ accepts electrons (becoming NADH) during the breakdown of nutrients, and NADH donates electrons (becoming NAD+) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. When people talk about "NAD+ levels declining with age," they're referring to the total pool of both forms, with particular emphasis on the NAD+/NADH ratio shifting unfavorably.

### Should I take NAD+ on an empty stomach?

For injectable NAD+ (subcutaneous or IV), food timing doesn't significantly affect absorption -- you're bypassing the digestive system entirely. For oral precursors like NMN or NR, some research suggests better absorption when taken on an empty stomach or with a fat source, but the data isn't conclusive enough to make a firm recommendation either way.

### How do I know if my NAD+ is working?

Subjectively, energy levels, sleep quality, and mental clarity are the most commonly reported early indicators. Objectively, some researchers use intracellular NAD+ blood testing (offered by a few specialty labs) to measure before-and-after levels. Other biomarkers that may respond over time include inflammatory markers (hs-CRP), fasting glucose, and mitochondrial function panels.
