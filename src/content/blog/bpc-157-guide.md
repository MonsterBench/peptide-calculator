BPC-157, short for Body Protection Compound-157, is one of the most extensively studied peptides in regenerative research. Derived from a protective protein found in gastric juice, this 15-amino-acid peptide has attracted serious attention for its remarkable tissue-repair properties observed across hundreds of preclinical studies. Whether you're new to peptide research or looking to refine an existing protocol, this guide covers everything from BPC-157 dosage calculations and reconstitution steps to stacking strategies with TB-500.

## What Is BPC-157?

BPC-157 (also referred to as PL 14736 or Bepecin) is a synthetic peptide consisting of 15 amino acids. Its sequence (Gly-Glu-Pro-Pro-Pro-Gly-Lys-Pro-Ala-Asp-Asp-Ala-Gly-Leu-Val) is derived from a larger protein called Body Protection Compound, which is naturally present in human gastric juice at very low concentrations.

Since the early 1990s, research teams primarily based in Croatia have published over 100 peer-reviewed studies investigating BPC-157 in animal models. The peptide has demonstrated a broad spectrum of protective and regenerative effects, including:

- **Tendon and ligament repair** -- accelerated healing of transected Achilles tendons and medial collateral ligaments in rat models
- **Muscle injury recovery** -- improved restoration of crushed and transected muscle tissue
- **Gastrointestinal protection** -- reduced lesion severity in ulcer, inflammatory bowel, and fistula models
- **Bone healing** -- enhanced osteogenic activity and fracture repair
- **Neuroprotection** -- protective effects against peripheral nerve damage and certain neurotoxic compounds
- **Vascular repair** -- promotion of angiogenesis and restoration of blood flow to injured tissue

The breadth of these findings has positioned BPC-157 as a leading candidate for further translational research in tissue regeneration. So what's actually going on at the molecular level? Let's dig into the mechanisms.

## Mechanism of Action

Understanding how BPC-157 works at the molecular level is essential for designing effective research protocols. While the complete mechanism is still under investigation (and honestly, there's still a lot we don't know), several well-documented pathways have emerged from the literature.

### Growth Factor Modulation

BPC-157 has been shown to upregulate the expression of key growth factors involved in tissue repair, including:

- **VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)** -- promotes the formation of new blood vessels at injury sites
- **EGF receptor expression** -- supports epithelial and connective tissue regeneration
- **NGF (Nerve Growth Factor)** -- implicated in peripheral nerve healing and neuroprotective effects

### Nitric Oxide System Interaction

Research indicates that BPC-157 modulates the nitric oxide (NO) system, which plays a central role in blood vessel dilation, inflammation regulation, and wound repair. The peptide appears to maintain NO homeostasis, which may explain its protective effects across multiple organ systems.

### FAK-Paxillin Pathway Activation

Studies have demonstrated that BPC-157 activates the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin signaling pathway. This pathway is critical for cell migration, adhesion, and spreading -- processes that are foundational to wound closure and tissue remodeling.

### Anti-Inflammatory Activity

BPC-157 has exhibited anti-inflammatory properties in numerous models, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and limiting oxidative damage. This dual role as both a pro-regenerative and anti-inflammatory agent may account for its efficacy across such a wide range of injury types.

## Research Dosing Protocols

Establishing the correct BPC-157 dosage is one of the most critical aspects of any research protocol. Dosing in the published literature is typically reported on a per-kilogram basis and administered via subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection.

### Standard Research Dosing

The most commonly referenced dosing range in animal studies is:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Low dose | 1 mcg/kg body weight |
| Standard dose | 10 mcg/kg body weight |
| High dose | 50 mcg/kg body weight |
| Frequency | Once or twice daily |
| Duration | 7 to 30 days (study dependent) |

The majority of published studies use the **10 mcg/kg** dose as the standard, which has consistently produced statistically significant results across injury models. Some researchers opt for a twice-daily BPC-157 protocol to maintain more stable peptide levels, particularly in acute injury models.

### Administration Routes

BPC-157 has been studied via several administration routes:

- **Subcutaneous (SC) injection** -- the most common route in research; allows for localized or systemic delivery depending on injection site
- **Intraperitoneal (IP) injection** -- frequently used in rodent studies for systemic exposure
- **Oral administration** -- notably, BPC-157 has shown efficacy when administered orally in several gastrointestinal studies, which is unusual for peptides that are typically degraded in the digestive tract
- **Topical application** -- applied in cream or solution form in wound-healing models

The peptide's stability in acidic environments is a distinguishing characteristic -- and frankly, it's pretty unusual. Unlike most peptides, BPC-157 doesn't degrade rapidly in gastric acid, which supports its oral bioavailability in GI-focused research.

### Protocol Duration

Most published BPC-157 protocols span **14 to 30 days** of daily administration. Shorter protocols of 7 to 10 days have been used in acute injury models, while longer protocols are employed for chronic conditions or complex tissue repair. Researchers typically include a washout period between cycles.

## How to Reconstitute BPC-157

Proper BPC-157 reconstitution is essential for maintaining peptide integrity and ensuring accurate dosing. BPC-157 is supplied as a lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder that must be reconstituted with an appropriate solvent before use.

### What You Need

- BPC-157 lyophilized vial (typically 5 mg)
- Bacteriostatic water (BAC water) -- the preferred solvent for multi-use reconstitution
- Sterile insulin syringes (1 mL / 100 unit)
- Alcohol swabs for vial tops

### Step-by-Step Reconstitution Instructions

1. **Clean the vial tops.** Wipe the tops of both the BPC-157 vial and the bacteriostatic water vial with an alcohol swab. Allow them to air dry.

2. **Draw the solvent.** Using a sterile syringe, draw your desired volume of bacteriostatic water. A common reconstitution for a 5 mg vial is **2 mL** of BAC water, which yields a concentration of **2.5 mg/mL** (or 2,500 mcg/mL).

3. **Inject slowly along the vial wall.** Insert the needle into the BPC-157 vial and release the bacteriostatic water slowly, aiming the stream against the inside wall of the vial. Do not spray directly onto the lyophilized powder, as this can damage the peptide structure.

4. **Swirl gently.** Once the solvent is added, gently swirl the vial in a circular motion until the powder is fully dissolved. The solution should be clear. Do not shake the vial vigorously -- peptides are fragile molecules that can denature under excessive agitation.

5. **Label and store.** Note the reconstitution date and concentration on the vial. Store in the refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius.

### Common Reconstitution Volumes and Concentrations

| Vial Size | BAC Water Added | Concentration | mcg per 0.1 mL (10 units) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 mg | 1 mL | 5,000 mcg/mL | 500 mcg |
| 5 mg | 2 mL | 2,500 mcg/mL | 250 mcg |
| 5 mg | 2.5 mL | 2,000 mcg/mL | 200 mcg |
| 10 mg | 2 mL | 5,000 mcg/mL | 500 mcg |
| 10 mg | 4 mL | 2,500 mcg/mL | 250 mcg |

## Stacking BPC-157 with TB-500

One of the most widely discussed combinations in peptide research is the **BPC-157 and TB-500 stack**. TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4) is a 43-amino-acid peptide that plays a key role in cell migration, blood vessel formation, and anti-inflammatory signaling. When combined with BPC-157, the two peptides target complementary repair pathways, which has led researchers to investigate their synergistic potential.

### Why Stack BPC-157 and TB-500?

The rationale for the BPC-157 TB-500 stack is based on their distinct but overlapping mechanisms:

- **BPC-157** primarily modulates growth factor expression (VEGF, EGF), the nitric oxide system, and FAK-paxillin signaling to drive localized tissue repair and angiogenesis.
- **TB-500** primarily promotes cell migration through upregulation of actin, reduces inflammation, and supports tissue remodeling on a more systemic level.

Together, these peptides address both the localized healing process and the broader systemic environment needed for recovery. Preclinical data suggest the combination may produce more robust results than either peptide alone, though direct head-to-head comparison studies remain limited.

### Example Research Stack Protocol

| Peptide | Dose | Frequency | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| BPC-157 | 250-500 mcg | Once or twice daily | 4-6 weeks |
| TB-500 | 2-2.5 mg | Twice per week (loading), then once per week (maintenance) | 4-6 weeks |

During the first two weeks (loading phase), TB-500 is typically administered twice per week. After the loading phase, the frequency is reduced to once per week for maintenance. BPC-157 is administered daily throughout the protocol.

## Storage and Stability

Proper storage is critical for preserving BPC-157 potency. Peptides are sensitive to heat, light, and bacterial contamination, so cutting corners here can ruin an otherwise well-designed protocol.

### Lyophilized (Pre-Reconstitution) Storage

- Store at **-20 degrees Celsius** (freezer) for long-term storage
- Acceptable at **2-8 degrees Celsius** (refrigerator) for up to several months
- Keep away from direct light -- store in original packaging or wrap in foil
- Properly stored lyophilized BPC-157 can remain stable for **24+ months**

### Reconstituted (Post-Reconstitution) Storage

- Store at **2-8 degrees Celsius** (refrigerator) -- never at room temperature
- Use **bacteriostatic water** as the solvent to inhibit microbial growth (the 0.9% benzyl alcohol in BAC water acts as a preservative)
- Reconstituted BPC-157 in BAC water remains stable for approximately **28-30 days** when refrigerated
- Do not freeze reconstituted peptide solutions, as freeze-thaw cycles can degrade the peptide
- Always use a clean, sterile syringe when drawing from the vial to prevent contamination

### Signs of Degradation

Reconstituted BPC-157 should be discarded if any of the following are observed:

- Cloudiness or particulate matter in the solution
- Discoloration (the solution should be clear and colorless)
- It has been more than 30 days since reconstitution
- The vial was exposed to temperatures above 8 degrees Celsius for extended periods
